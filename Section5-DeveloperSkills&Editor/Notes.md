Notes:
Learning how to code:

- Specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goal
- Imagine a big project that I want be able to build
- Research technologies that I need then learn them

-Understand the code that I'm studying and typing
-Always type the code, don't copy-paste

-After I learn a new feature or concept, use it immediately
-Take notes
-Challenge yourself and practice with small coding exercises and challenges
-Don't be hurry to complete the course

Mistakes
-Practicing on your own is the most important thing to do
-This is not optional! Without practice outside of courses, you won't go anywhere
-Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications, or just parts of them in the beginning
-Don't be stuck in "tutorial hell"
-Don't get stuck trying to write perfect code

- Just write tons of code, no matter the quality!
  -Clean and efficient code will come with time
  -You can always refactor code later
  -Embrace the fact that you will never know everything
  -Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal
  -Explain new concepts to other people. If you can explain it, you truly understand it!
  -Share your goals to make yourself accountable
  -Share your learning progress with the web dev community (#100DaysOfCode, #CodeNewbie, #webdeb, etc.)
  -Stay motivated, keep writing lots of code on your own, no matter how bad.
  -Learn with other people, devs and beginners, and share progress
  -Keep challenging yourself, run into lots of problems, and fix them
  -Round up your skill set with best practices and tools (git, testing...)
  -Job ready (but learning never stops)

Problem solving skills:
WRONG WAY:
-Jump at the problem without much thinking
-Implement a solution in an unstructured way
-Too proud to research solutions

RIGHT WAY:
-Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan
-Take a very logical and rational approach(programming is just logic, in the end..)
-Use 4-step framework to solve any problem

**FRAMEWORK**
-Make sure that you 100% understand the problem. **Ask the right questions** to get a clear picture of the whole problem.
Example: Project Manager: "We need a function that reverses whatever we pass into it"
1st question: What does "whatever" even mean in this context? What should be reversed? Answer: Only strings, numbers, and arrays make sense to reverse..
2nd question: "What to do if something else is passed in?"
3rd question: "What should be returned?" Should it always be a string, or should the type be the same as passed in?
4th question: How to recognize whether the argument is a number, a string, or an array?
5th question: How to reverse a number, a string and an array?

**Divide and conquer**: break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.
-check if argument is a number is a string, or an array.
-implement reversing a number
-implement reversing a string
-implement reversing an array
-return reversed value

Don't be afraid to do as much **research **as you have to

For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code

**BUGS**
Unexpected result
Def: Identify (Becoming aware that there is a bug):

- During development
- Testing software
- User reports during production
- Context: browsers, users, etc.

Find (Isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code):

- Developer console (simple code)
- Debugger (complex code)

Fix (Correcting the bug)

- Searching for the same bug in similar code
- Writing tests using testing software
